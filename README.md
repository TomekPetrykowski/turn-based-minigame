# Turn-based game project

A project I made to simplify learning of OOP in Python for my colleagues in the [**Work In Progress**](https://wip-ug.web.app/) science club.

### Instalation

First of all you need to clone repository:

If you have SSH keys configured:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TomekPetrykowski/turn-based-minigame.git
```

Or you can just use HTTPS version:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:TomekPetrykowski/turn-based-minigame.git
```

Once you clone game's repository:

1. Enter directory: `cd turn-based-game`
2. Make virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Start your new environment:
   1. If you are in Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
   2. If you are in Unix Systems (Mac OS, Linux): `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
4. Install requirements: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

> [!NOTE] If you are using Unix system, it is highly possible that you have to replace `python` with `python3` in all commands above.

And it's all set! Good luck with developing this game!
